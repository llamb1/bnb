                    <p>Hey there! Thanks for checking out Dark Lamb Studios' web-based text adventure, Black and Blu! We're still in the process of figuring things out, but we're thrilled that you're joining us on this journey.</p>
                    <p>When it comes to saving your progress, we've taken inspiration from the good old days of keycode technology that were all the rage back in the 1980s. To save your game, simply click the [save] button and a code will be generated based on the items in your inventory and the plot points you've encountered so far. The code might be quite lengthy, so we recommend copying and pasting it somewhere safe on your device - whether that's your computer, phone, tablet, or even an ancient scroll!</p>
                    <p>At DLS, we believe in respecting your privacy, which is why we prefer not to access your personal information. We trust that you'll take care of your own saved codes. Plus, who knows what cool things you might be able to achieve if you tinker with those codes? The possibilities are endless!</p>
